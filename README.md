# OpenThread Registrar

The [Constrained Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (cBRSKI)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-anima-constrained-voucher) IETF draft defines a Domain Registrar for securely onboarding new IoT devices into a network domain with zero-touch.

OpenThread's implementation of a cBRSKI Domain Registrar, used for onboarding Thread devices, is called OpenThread Registrar (OT Registrar).

> Note: OT Registrar is still under development. We do not recommend using it in production yet.
